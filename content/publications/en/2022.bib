abstract = {In modern desktop environments, a windowing system allows multiple applications to be displayed simultaneously and work together, but in today's immersive environments, multitasking with multiple applications is very limited. Therefore, we designed and developed a windowing system, ZIGEN, from the ground up to achieve multitasking among 3D and 2D applications.},
