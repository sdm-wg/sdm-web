abstract = {Direct peer-to-peer (P2P) communication is often used to minimize the end-to-end latency for real-time applications that require accurate synchronization, such as remote musical ensembles. However, there are few studies on the performance of P2P communication between home network environments, thus hindering the deployment of services that require synchronization. In this study, we developed a P2P performance measurement tool using the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) statistics application programming interface. Using this tool, we can easily measure P2P performance between home network environments on a web browser without downloading client applications. We also verified the reliability of round-trip time (RTT) measurements using WebRTC and confirmed that our system could provide the necessary measurement accuracy for RTT and jitter measurements for real-time applications. In addition, we measured the performance of a full mesh topology connection with 10 users in an actual environment in Japan. Consequently, we found that only 66% of the peer connections had a latency of 30 ms or less, which is the minimum requirement for high synchronization applications, such as musical ensembles.},

abstract = {Exploring the most task-friendly camera setting---optimal camera placement (OCP) problem---in tasks that use multiple cameras is of great importance. However, few existing OCP solutions specialize in depth observation of indoor scenes, and most versatile solutions work offline. To this problem, an OCP online solution to depth observation of indoor scenes based on reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper. The proposed solution comprises a simulation environment that implements scene observation and reward estimation using shadow maps and an agent network containing a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning backbone and a feature extractor to extract features from the observed point cloud layer-by-layer. Comparative experiments with two state-of-the-art optimization-based offline methods are conducted. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system outperforms seven out of ten test scenes in obtaining lower depth observation error. The total error in all test scenes is also less than 90% of the baseline ones. Therefore, the proposed system is more competent for depth camera placement in scenarios where there is no prior knowledge of the scenes or where a lower depth observation error is the main objective.},
