abstract = {In recent years, the digital twin has emerged in the fields of building automation systems (BAS) and factory automation (FA). It is expected that information in real space can be reproduced in digital space to optimize control and management. On the other hand, data management of physical assets in each control and management paradigm has problems such as heterogeneity of data models and silos. To solve these problems, data modeling utilizing semantics has been attracting attention. In this study, we proposed and evaluated an ontology for representing digital twins for indoor spaces.},

abstract = {In modern desktop environments, a windowing system allows multiple applications to be displayed simultaneously and work together, but in today's immersive environments, multitasking with multiple applications is very limited. Therefore, we designed and developed a windowing system, ZIGEN, from the ground up to achieve multitasking among 3D and 2D applications.},
